        <h4><big>What is MNC?</big></h4>    
        <p>MNC typically stands for "Multinational Corporation" or "Multinational Company." 
            It refers to a business entity that operates in multiple countries and has a presence in 
            more than one nation. These companies engage in international trade and investment, 
            often establishing subsidiaries, branches, or offices in various countries to expand 
            their market reach and take advantage of global opportunities.</p>

        <p>When categorizing Multinational Corporations (MNCs) based on their primary activities, two broad types are often distinguished: product-based MNCs and service-based MNCs. These categories differentiate companies based on whether they primarily deal in tangible goods (products) or intangible offerings (services).
            <h4>1.Product-Based MNCs:</h4>
               <p>These MNCs primarily focus on the production and sale of tangible goods or products. This can include manufacturing companies that produce items such as automobiles, electronics, clothing, and consumer goods.
               Ex: Amazon,Apple,Google etc</p>
            <h4>2.Service-Based MNCs:</h4>
               <p>MNCs are companies that predominantly offer intangible services rather than physical products. These services can include financial services, consulting, information technology, telecommunications, and more.
